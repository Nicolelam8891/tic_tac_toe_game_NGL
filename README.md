## Tic-Tac-Toe

> I created this app for my daughter, who is 1.5 years-old. She loves playing with this app on my computer and also on my phone! The confetti was a bit hit!
- A scoreboard is presented
- Once a player wins, confetti will appear and the winner will be announced
- A player can click on new game and a new game will be displayed
- If there is a draw, that will be announced

## Challenges and Wins
- This app was influenced by my rock-paper-scissors app that I created in the first semester of Turing School of Software & Design
- The logic was different because I did not look at my old code to create this app
- I had a bit of trouble with responsive design trying to make it responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- It took me a little bit longer to figure out the logic to calculate and update the scores
- This was the first time I used confetti and it was very exciting to implement
- My daughter loves to play with this
- I learned a lot creating this app, I am new to the coding world so repetition and coding more frequently has helped me learn more!
