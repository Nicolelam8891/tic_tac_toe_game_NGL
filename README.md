## Tic-Tac-Toe

> I created this app for my daughter, who is 1.5 years-old. She loves playing with this app on my computer and also on my phone! The confetti was a bit hit! 
- This app was influenced by my rock-paper-scissors app that I created in the first semester of Turing School of Software & Design. 
- I had a bit of trouble with responsive design trying to make it responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- It took me a little bit longer to figure out the logic to calculate and update the scores
- This was the first time I used confetti and it was very exciting to implement
